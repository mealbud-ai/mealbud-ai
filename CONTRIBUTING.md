# Contributing to @pglabs/next-prisma

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Here's how to get started.

## 🛠 Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mealbud-ai/mealbud-ai.git
cd mealbud-ai
pnpm install
```
> We use pnpm workspaces to manage monorepo dependencies. If you don't have pnpm installed, install it.

## 🚧 Development

Make your changes in a feature branch (or other adapted prefixed branch name):

```bash
git checkout -b feat/my-awesome-feature # or bugfix/my-awesome-bug
```

Make sure:

- Code is clean and typed
- You've run the linter and formatter before creating a PR
- What you've done is following the idea of the project (see the discussion github page)
- YOU DID WRITE TESTS 
- You don't break the build (npm run build)

## ✅ Checklist before PR

- Code compiles
- Only relevant changes are committed
- README.md is updated if needed
- You followed the existing coding style

## 📦 Publishing

Only maintainers can publish to production.
I will handle that part and make sure you are mentioned in the release notes !

## 🙏 Thanks

Whether it's a typo fix or a new feature — your help is appreciated!
